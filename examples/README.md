# Examples

Here are three implemented examples that use the Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text services of AWS and GCP.
Each example has been implemented five times:

* AWS Polly with only AWS SDK
* AWS Polly with GoText2Speech
* GCP T2S with only GCP SDK
* GCP T2S with GoText2Speech
* GCP T2S & AWS Polly with only AWS & GCP SDKs

The AWS examples are runnable as AWS Lambda functions, and the GCP examples are runnable as Google Cloud Functions.
